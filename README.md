# PodCloud

## Overview
**PodCloud** is a web application to help users search for podcasts instead of using Itunes to do so. As a user signed up for the site they are able to create multiple playlists and add their selected podcasts to one of their created playlist. I built this app so it can help me listen to more podcasts because one could learn a lot from listening to many different podcasts. Podcasts are Awesome!!!
